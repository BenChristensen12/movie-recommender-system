# movie-recommender-system
This is a collaborative project by Benjamin Burt and Ben Christensen. The goal is to create the best movie-recommender system we can using machine learning algorithms we can find including KMeans, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and others. We use the publicly available dataset from https://movielens.org
